# ðŸ“˜ Day 7: Memory Management â€“ Paging & Segmentation

---

## ðŸ§  What is Memory Management?

Memory Management is the function of the OS that handles:

- Allocation and deallocation of memory space
- Tracking memory usage
- Ensuring efficient access and protection

## ðŸ§© Logical vs Physical Address

| Term                         | Description                                |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Logical Address              | Address generated by CPU (virtual address) |
| Physical Address             | Actual address in main memory              |
| MMU (Memory Management Unit) | Translates logical â†’ physical address      |

## ðŸ“¦ Paging

Paging is a memory management scheme that eliminates the need for contiguous memory allocation.

### ðŸ”¹ Key Concepts:

- **Logical memory** is divided into **pages** (fixed size)
- **Physical memory** is divided into **frames** (same size)
- **Page Table** maps pages â†’ frames

### ðŸ§® Address Translation

```plaintext
Logical Address = Page Number + Offset
MMU uses Page Table:
    Frame Number = PageTable[Page Number]
Physical Address = Frame Number + Offset
```

Page Number = 2050 / 1024 = 2
Offset = 2050 % 1024 = 2

Physical Address = (5 Ã— 1024) + 2 = 5122
