# üìò Day 20: I/O Management, Buffering, and Device Drivers

---

## üîß What is I/O Management?

I/O (Input/Output) management refers to how the **Operating System handles communication between hardware devices** and the system.

Objectives:

- Efficient I/O handling
- Abstraction from device specifics
- Error handling and buffering

## üß± I/O Hardware Components

| Component   | Description                                |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| I/O Devices | Keyboards, disks, displays, printers, etc. |
| Controllers | Manage data flow to/from device            |
| Ports       | Interface between device & computer        |
| Buses       | Transfer data among CPU, memory, I/O       |

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è I/O Techniques

1. **Programmed I/O**

   - CPU directly controls data transfer.
   - Wastes CPU time during I/O.

2. **Interrupt-Driven I/O**

   - Device interrupts CPU when ready.
   - More efficient than programmed I/O.

3. **DMA (Direct Memory Access)**
   - Device controller transfers data directly to memory.
   - CPU is free during data transfer.

## üîÅ I/O Scheduling

Like disk scheduling, OS decides the **order in which I/O requests** are handled to maximize throughput and minimize latency.

---

## üì¶ Buffering

Buffering stores data in memory **temporarily during I/O operations** to accommodate speed differences between producer and consumer.

---

### üß© Types of Buffering

| Type                   | Description                                              |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Single Buffering**   | One buffer, either being filled or emptied               |
| **Double Buffering**   | Two buffers used alternately                             |
| **Circular Buffering** | Multiple buffers used in rotation for continuous streams |

---

### ‚úÖ Benefits of Buffering

- Reduces device idle time
- Smoothens speed mismatch
- Allows asynchronous I/O

---

## üß† Caching vs Buffering

| Feature  | Buffering                   | Caching                    |
| -------- | --------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Purpose  | Speed match between devices | Store frequently used data |
| Data Use | Temporary                   | Repeated                   |
| Location | RAM (usually)               | RAM or dedicated cache     |

## üß∞ Device Drivers

Device drivers are **software modules that handle communication with hardware devices**.

- Provide interface between OS and hardware
- Translate OS requests into device-specific commands

---

### üß© Types of Device Drivers

| Type                  | Description                                   |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Character Drivers** | For character-based devices (keyboard, mouse) |
| **Block Drivers**     | For block-based devices (hard disks, SSDs)    |
| **Network Drivers**   | For network interfaces                        |
| **Virtual Drivers**   | Interface with virtual devices                |

---

### üì¶ Driver Responsibilities

- Initialize hardware
- Manage device registers
- Handle interrupts
- Transfer data
- Report status/errors

---

## ‚úÖ Key Takeaways

- I/O management ensures efficient and reliable device interaction.
- Buffering bridges speed gaps between CPU and devices.
- Device drivers abstract hardware complexity for the OS.
- DMA and interrupt-driven I/O reduce CPU load.
