## 🔁 What is Page Replacement?

When memory is full and a new page is needed, the OS must **choose a page to remove** from RAM. This is handled using **Page Replacement Algorithms**.

---

## 🧠 Why Important?

- Efficient replacement reduces **page faults**.
- Poor strategies lead to **thrashing** and performance drops.

### 1. **FIFO (First-In First-Out)**

- Removes the oldest page in memory.

**Example:**
