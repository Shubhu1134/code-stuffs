### 3. Types of Operating Systems

- **Batch OS**: No user interaction, jobs are processed in batches.
- **Time-Sharing OS**: Allows multiple users to use system simultaneously.
- **Distributed OS**: Resources distributed across multiple computers.
- **Real-Time OS**: Responds to input within a fixed time.
- **Network OS**: Provides services over network.
- **Mobile OS**: Designed for mobile devices.

### 4. Operating System Services

- Program execution
- I/O operations
- File system manipulation
- Communication
- Error detection
- Resource allocation
- Protection and security

### 5. System Calls

- Provide interface between user programs and OS.
- Types:

  - Process control (create, terminate)
  - File management (open, read, write)
  - Device management (request, release)
  - Information maintenance (get time, date)
  - Communication (send, receive messages)

### 6. System Programs

- Provide environment for program development and execution.
- Types:

  - File manipulation
  - Status information
  - Programming language support
  - Communication programs

### 7. OS Structure

- **Monolithic**: All OS services run in kernel space.
- **Layered**: OS divided into layers.
- **Microkernel**: Minimal OS runs in kernel mode, rest in user mode.
- **Modules**: Loadable kernel modules.
- **Hybrid**: Combination of monolithic and microkernel.

### 8. OS Operations

- Interrupt handling
- Dual-mode operation (user mode vs kernel mode)
- Timer for preventing infinite loops
- Device and resource management

### 9. Virtual Machines

- Abstraction of physical hardware.
- Allows multiple OS on single hardware.
- Examples: VirtualBox, VMware, Hyper-V

## âœ… UNIT 2: Process Management

### 1. Process Concept

- A process is a program in execution.
- Has PCB (Process Control Block) with process details.

### 2. Process Scheduling

- Determines which process runs next.
- Types:

  - Long-term
  - Short-term
  - Medium-term

### 3. Scheduling Criteria

- CPU utilization
- Throughput
- Turnaround time
- Waiting time
- Response time

### 4. Scheduling Algorithms

- **FCFS** â€“ First Come First Serve
- **SJF** â€“ Shortest Job First
- **Priority** â€“ Based on priority
- **Round Robin** â€“ Time slicing
- **Multilevel Queue**

### 5. Threads

- Light-weight process.
- Share same memory but have own registers.
- Types:

  - User threads
  - Kernel threads

### 6. Multithreading Models

- Many-to-One
- One-to-One
- Many-to-Many

### 7. Interprocess Communication (IPC)

- Mechanism to allow processes to communicate.
- Methods:

  - Shared Memory
  - Message Passing

### 8. Process Synchronization

- Ensures orderly execution when processes share resources.
- Critical Section Problem â€“ Only one process in critical section at a time.

### 9. Synchronization Tools

- Semaphores
- Mutex
- Monitors

### 10. Classical Synchronization Problems

- Producer-Consumer
- Readers-Writers
- Dining Philosophers

### 11. Deadlock

- Processes wait indefinitely for resources.

### 12. Deadlock Handling

- **Prevention** â€“ Negate one of four necessary conditions.
- **Avoidance** â€“ Bankerâ€™s Algorithm.
- **Detection & Recovery**

## âœ… UNIT 3: Memory Management

### 1. Memory Management Background

- Main memory: volatile, fast access.
- Managed by OS to allocate memory to processes.

### 2. Swapping

- Moving processes between main memory and disk.

### 3. Contiguous Memory Allocation

- Each process in one contiguous block.
- Strategies: First-fit, Best-fit, Worst-fit.

### 4. Paging

- Divides memory into fixed-size blocks (pages/frames).
- Removes external fragmentation.

### 5. Segmentation

- Divides memory based on logical divisions (code, data, stack).

### 6. Virtual Memory

- Uses disk as extension of RAM.
- Processes can execute without being entirely in memory.

### 7. Demand Paging

- Pages loaded only when needed.

### 8. Page Replacement Algorithms

- FIFO, LRU, Optimal

### 9. Thrashing

- Excessive paging reduces performance.

## âœ… UNIT 4: Storage Management

### 1. File Concept

- Files are stored data with attributes (name, type, size).

### 2. File Access Methods

- Sequential
- Direct
- Indexed

### 3. Directory Structure

- Single-level
- Two-level
- Tree
- Acyclic Graph
- General Graph

### 4. File System Mounting

- Make file system available to OS.

### 5. File Sharing and Protection

- Access rights (read, write, execute).

### 6. Allocation Methods

- Contiguous
- Linked
- Indexed

### 7. Free Space Management

- Bit Map
- Linked List
- Grouping
- Counting

### 8. Disk Structure and Scheduling

- Disk Scheduling:

  - FCFS
  - SSTF
  - SCAN
  - C-SCAN
