# ðŸ“˜ Operating Systems â€“ Unit 1 Notes

## âœ… UNIT 1: Introduction to Operating Systems

---

### ### 1. Function of Operating System

An Operating System (OS) acts as an **interface** between users and hardware, managing resources and services.

#### Main Functions:

- **Process Management**: Scheduling and execution of processes.
- **Memory Management**: Allocation and deallocation of memory.
- **File Management**: Handling of data storage and access.
- **Device Management**: Managing I/O devices via drivers.
- **Security and Protection**: Controlling access to system resources.

#### Example:

In Windows OS, when a user opens Chrome, the OS allocates CPU time, memory, and manages file and network access.

### ### 2. Evolution of Operating Systems

#### Generations of OS:

1. **1st Generation (1940sâ€“50s)**: No OS â€“ machines were hardwired.
2. **2nd Generation (1950sâ€“60s)**: Batch systems using punched cards.
3. **3rd Generation (1960sâ€“70s)**: Multiprogramming and time-sharing (e.g., UNIX).
4. **4th Generation (1980sâ€“Now)**: GUI-based OS like Windows, Linux, macOS.
5. **5th Generation (Modern)**: Distributed, real-time, cloud-based, mobile OS.

### ### 3. Different Types of Operating Systems

#### Types:

- **Batch OS** â€“ Jobs executed in groups.
- **Time-Sharing OS** â€“ Allocates time slice per user (e.g., UNIX).
- **Distributed OS** â€“ Multiple systems act as one (e.g., Amoeba).
- **Real-Time OS** â€“ Deadline-critical systems (e.g., RTLinux, VxWorks).
- **Network OS** â€“ Connected computers managed together (e.g., Novell NetWare).
- **Mobile OS** â€“ Android, iOS.

### ### 4. Desirable Characteristics and Features of an Operating System

#### Key Features:

- **Efficiency**: Maximizing performance with minimal resource usage.
- **Reliability**: Stable and error-resistant.
- **Security**: Protects against unauthorized access.
- **Scalability**: Performs well as hardware expands.
- **User Interface**: CLI or GUI.
- **Portability**: Runs on different hardware (e.g., Linux across systems).

---

### ### 5. Operating System Services â€“ Types of Services

#### Common OS Services:

- **Program Execution**
- **I/O Operations**
- **File System Manipulation**
- **Communication (IPC)**
- **Error Detection**
- **Resource Allocation**
- **Security & Protection**

> Example: Linux provides these services via system calls like `open()`, `read()`, `fork()`.

---

### ### 6. Different Ways of Providing Services

#### a. **System Calls**:

Functions provided by OS for direct request to kernel services.

> Example:  
> `read(fd, buffer, size)` in C accesses file data directly.

#### b. **Utility Programs**:

User-facing tools provided by OS.

> Examples:

- Disk Cleanup, Task Manager (Windows)
- `ls`, `top`, `df` (Linux)
