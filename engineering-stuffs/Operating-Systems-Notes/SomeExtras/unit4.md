## âœ… UNIT 4: MEMORY MANAGEMENT

---

### 1. Introduction to Memory Management

Memory management is the functionality of an operating system that handles or manages the primary memory.

> Goal: Efficiently allocate memory to processes and keep the system fast and responsive.

---

### 2. Logical vs Physical Address

| Type                             | Description                                             |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Logical Address**              | Generated by the CPU; also known as **virtual address** |
| **Physical Address**             | Actual address in the memory unit                       |
| **MMU (Memory Management Unit)** | Translates logical to physical address dynamically      |

---

### 3. Address Binding

| Binding Time       | Description                                          |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Compile Time**   | Absolute addresses generated                         |
| **Load Time**      | Addresses generated during program loading           |
| **Execution Time** | Binding done by MMU during execution (most flexible) |

---

### 4. Dynamic Loading and Linking

- **Dynamic Loading**: Loads routines only when needed (saves memory)
- **Dynamic Linking**: Libraries linked at runtime, not compile time

---

### 5. Contiguous Memory Allocation

#### A. Fixed Partitioning

- Memory divided into fixed-size partitions
- One process per partition

#### B. Variable Partitioning

- Memory divided based on process size
- Can lead to **external fragmentation**

---

### 6. Fragmentation

| Type         | Description                                         |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **External** | Wasted space outside allocated regions (contiguous) |
| **Internal** | Wasted space inside allocated memory block          |

##### Solution:

- Compaction: Rearranging memory contents to eliminate external fragmentation

---

### 7. Non-Contiguous Allocation

#### A. Paging

- Divides memory into fixed-size blocks:
  - **Frames** (physical memory)
  - **Pages** (logical memory)

> Every process has a page table for translation

##### Advantages:

- Eliminates external fragmentation

##### Disadvantages:

- Page table overhead
- Internal fragmentation possible

---

#### B. Segmentation

- Divides logical memory into **segments** (code, stack, heap, etc.)
- Each segment has a segment number and offset

##### Comparison:

| Feature  | Paging           | Segmentation           |
| -------- | ---------------- | ---------------------- |
| Division | Fixed-size pages | Variable-size segments |
| View     | Physical         | Logical                |

---

### 8. Virtual Memory

> Virtual memory allows execution of processes that may not be completely in memory.

- Uses **demand paging** and **page replacement**

---

### 9. Demand Paging

- Pages loaded into memory **only when needed**
- If a page is not in memory â†’ **Page Fault**

##### Components:

- **Page Table**
- **Frame Table**
- **Disk (Backing Store)**

---

### 10. Page Replacement Algorithms

When memory is full, we must **replace a page**:

| Algorithm   | Description                                                  |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **FIFO**    | Replace oldest page (first-in)                               |
| **LRU**     | Replace least recently used page                             |
| **Optimal** | Replace page that won't be used soon (ideal but theoretical) |

---

### 11. Thrashing

When system spends more time **swapping pages** in and out than executing processes.

##### Causes:

- Too many processes in memory
- Poor page replacement

##### Solution:

- Use **working set model** to limit degree of multiprogramming

---

### 12. Working Set Model

- Keeps track of the set of pages a process is currently using
- Allocate enough frames to avoid thrashing

---

### 13. Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB)

- A small hardware cache in MMU
- Speeds up logical to physical address translation

---

## âœ… Summary Table

| Term           | Meaning                                            |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Paging         | Fixed-size division, avoids external fragmentation |
| Segmentation   | Logical division, more natural to programmer       |
| Virtual Memory | Uses disk to pretend more memory is available      |
| Page Fault     | Page not in memory, needs to be loaded from disk   |
| TLB            | Fast memory for address translation                |
| Thrashing      | Excessive paging reduces system performance        |
