## 🎨 Toastmasters Clock (Signals)

Toastmasters uses a **Green–Yellow–Red signal system** for timing.

- 🟢 **Green = Minimum time achieved** → Safe zone.
- 🟡 **Yellow = Midpoint** → Time to wrap up.
- 🔴 **Red = Maximum time** → Must stop (30 sec grace).

### Examples:

- **Prepared Speech (5–7 min):** Green @ 5:00, Yellow @ 6:00, Red @ 7:00
- **Table Topics (1–2 min):** Green @ 1:00, Yellow @ 1:30, Red @ 2:00
- **Evaluation (2–3 min):** Green @ 2:00, Yellow @ 2:30, Red @ 3:00
