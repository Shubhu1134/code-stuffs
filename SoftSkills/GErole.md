**General Evaluator (GE)** role in a Toastmasters meeting. This is an important leadership role because you **evaluate the entire meeting**—not just one speech. Let me break it down for you step by step so you can prepare with confidence:

---

## 🎤 Role of General Evaluator (GE)

The GE is like the “overall judge/observer” of the meeting. You observe **how well the meeting is conducted**, the **prepared speeches**, the **evaluations**, and the **support role players**. At the end, you give feedback to improve future meetings.

---

## 📝 Structure of GE’s Evaluation

When you are called to deliver your report (usually 5–8 minutes), you should cover:

### 1️⃣ Opening

- Thank the **Toastmaster of the Day (TMOD)**.
- Briefly explain **your role**:
  _“As General Evaluator, my job is to look at the entire meeting and provide feedback on what went well and what can be improved.”_

---

### 2️⃣ Evaluation of Meeting Flow

Comment on:

- **Start & time management** (Did we start on time? Did sessions run smoothly?)
- **Transitions** (How well TMOD moved from one segment to another)
- **Energy & engagement** (Was the audience lively, clapping, encouraging?)
- **Meeting theme** (If there was a theme, was it maintained?)

---

### 3️⃣ Evaluation of Role Players

Go through **each supporting role**:

- **Grammarian** → Word/idiom choice, clarity, encouragement.
- **Ah-Counter** → Accuracy and presentation.
- **Timer** → Clear signals, confident reporting.
- **Table Topic Master (TTM)** → Creativity of topics, fairness, energy.
- **Prepared Speech Evaluators** → Were they constructive, balanced, and encouraging?

⚡ Tip: Don’t repeat what they already said. Instead, **evaluate how they performed their role.**

---

### 4️⃣ Evaluation of Prepared Speech Evaluators

Yes, you evaluate the evaluators!

- Did they follow the **CRC method (Commend, Recommend, Commend)**?
- Did they give **specific, actionable feedback**?
- Did they balance positivity and areas of improvement?

---

### 5️⃣ Overall Strengths of Meeting

Give 2–3 **positive highlights**, e.g.:

- Good audience participation.
- Strong use of humor.
- Smooth transitions.

---

### 6️⃣ Recommendations for Improvement

Give 2–3 **areas to improve**, e.g.:

- Encourage more applause after each role.
- Remind speakers about timing.
- Improve energy at the beginning of the meeting.

---

### 7️⃣ Closing

End on a **positive and motivational note**:
_“Overall, this was a very energetic meeting with great learnings. With a little more focus on time management and smoother transitions, we can make the next one even better. Thank you!”_

## 🎯 Practice Example (Short Script)

> “Thank you TMOD. As General Evaluator, my job was to look at the entire meeting.

> The Grammarian introduced a strong word, though next time they could encourage more members to use it. The Ah-Counter gave a clear and confident report. The Timer did well, though a reminder earlier about time signals would help.
> Evaluators gave very constructive feedback, especially balancing strengths and areas for improvement.
> Overall, I enjoyed the meeting. My suggestions are: improve transitions between sessions, involve the audience a little more, and make sure to manage time tightly.
